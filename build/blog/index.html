<h3><b>Club Newsletter 2019</b><hr></h3>

<h4><i>2019-01-01</i></h4>
<div class="general-updates">
  <h4><p><strong><em>2019 Newsletter</em></strong></p>
<p>In less than a month, anglers will once again be travelling to the Bandon River as a
new season begins. Fishermen can only hope for more rain and better fishing conditions this
year. 2018 was possibly the most difficult season in history for anyone fishing the Bandon.
Spring salmon fishing in April was extremely encouraging and there is a growing trend
towards better late spring fishing. However, from May onwards, the river was gripped by
drought conditions and dredging works associated with the Bandon Flood Relief Scheme
commenced for a second year. The scorching summer meant fishing for much of it was a
fruitless exercise and members were requested to restrain from fishing on a voluntary basis.
Thankfully, the sky to the west darkened in September and the river finally received the
flood it was so badly craving. Excellent salmon fishing was enjoyed but most fish were stale
and released again. Unfortunately, sea trout fishing was non-existent due to the drought
and dredging works. Brown trout fishing was good up to mid-June but difficult from then on.
Will drier, hotter summers become the norm? The wet summer of 2015 seems like a distant
memory.<br><br></p>
<p>Fishing will continue on as normal, with opening day on February 15 th . Refreshments
will be served on St. Patrick’s Day, March 17th in the Munster Arms Hotel, Bandon, from
7.00pm. As always, we remind anglers to record all salmon and sea trout over 40cm in their
logbooks whether they are retained or released, including salmon kelts, baggots and
rawners. Taking into consideration negative effects incurred by the flood relief scheme,
compulsory catch and release of all trout is being implemented on all club waters below
Bandon Weir. This rule may be in place for a couple of seasons and will be lifted once it is
deemed suitable to do so.<br><br></p>
<p>The dates set for payment of club permits are the <em>4th and 5th of February</em> from 7.00
pm to 9.30 pm in the Munster Arms Hotel. Season permit prices for the upcoming season
remain the same at <em>€150</em> and IFI state licenses will also be available for purchase. Payment for state licenses is by cash only. An option for online payment is available for club permits. Please email <em>info@bandonangling.com</em> for further information. We would advise all members prompt payment of subs and for administration purposes, a strict deadline has been set for <em>Monday April 1st</em> . <em>Member permits will not be issued after this date</em>. We request all members to familiarise themselves with the updated club rules outlined on their permits. As usual, when receiving your permit you will also obtain a tag for your jacket/hat. This is a
visual aid to help fishery officers, water keepers and anglers alike to identify whether
someone should be fishing or not. We must stress this is not a licence and you must still
carry your permit. This year, club members are required to fill out General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) forms. Forms are included with the newsletter and will be available for
members to sign on the permit nights. <em>Permits will not be issued to members until we are inreceipt of GDPR forms</em>.<br><br></p>
<p>Weekend patrolling by club members was conducted in a very successful manner last
year, with cases of poaching declining over the summer. We sincerely thank you for all your
efforts. If you suspect a non-member is fishing, do not approach them and contact the
designated persons whose details are below. This spring, work parties will be organised to
clean river banks for the 2019 season. Our aim is to begin these soon and we encourage all members to help out as much as possible when asked. Work parties will offer members the
opportunity to get to know the river better and offer a chance to meet more fellow anglers.<br><br></p>
<p>Bandon Angling Association hopes to carry out spawning stream enhancement work
which will be extremely beneficial to our population of trout in particular. This includes
fencing, tree coppicing, gravel raking and designating livestock drinking areas. Additionally, we have ear marked sections of the main channel which require fencing to exclude livestock from the river. This will decrease river bank erosion, benefit instream habitat for trout and salmon as well as water quality in general. A River Works Fund, which will be ring fenced for similar projects to improve the river and fishing for all, is available for anyone to donate to. Please email <em>info@bandonangling.com</em> for further information. All contributions are very welcome. <br><br></p>
<p>Water quality will receive a welcome boost on the Bandon this year as works have
commenced for the Bandon Watermain and Sewage upgrade. Thankfully, after much
pressure from BAA, the Innishannon Sewage Scheme will begin this year. The Bandon
Rivers Trust has been formed and the objective will be to protect, conserve and enhance
biodiversity throughout the Bandon catchment. With regards to the Bandon Flood Relief
Scheme, monitoring was conducted throughout the works period by 3 ecologists on a full
time basis. Where parameter limits were exceeded, works were downgraded/halted to
prevent injury to aquatic species. Instream works will commence once again in May of this
year.<br><br></p>
<p>After 4 years of dedicated service as chairman of the Bandon Angling Association,
Robert Smith has stepped down from his role. Rob’s commitment to the club and towards
it’s betterment for all members was immense. In his place comes Phil Dewey and we have
no doubt he will lead the club into a new era with his infectious enthusiasm!! <br><br></p>

<h3><b>Salmon Life Cycle</b><hr></h3>

<h4><i>2017-02-10</i></h4>
<div class="general-updates">
  <h4><p>Amazing looking at a salmon and thinking of its life history .
This fish would have been laid as an egg in autumn/winter 2011.
Born spring 2012.
Grew up and developed as a parr in the Bandon for 2 years.
Migrated as a smolt in spring 2014.
Swam up the Norwegian Sea to the Faroe Islands for one winter.
Decided one winter wasn't enough and swam over to Greenland for winter 2015.
2016 came around, the Multi Sea Winter adult fish matured and migrated along the north Atlantic Ocean back to its native waters in West Cork to breed the next generation of salmon.
Life cycle complete.</p>

<h3><b>Club Newsletter 2017</b><hr></h3>

<h4><i>2017-02-05</i></h4>
<div class="general-updates">
  <h4><p><strong><em>2018 Newsletter</em></strong></p>
<p>It’s coming to that time of year again when excitement is growing as we get our fishing
tackle in order for the new season ahead. 2017 was very similar to 2016 as we witnessed
relatively low rainfall amounts and prolonged dry spells. This, coupled with the dredging
downstream of Bandon, restricted angling opportunities from May onwards. As a
consequence, many anglers found the season tough going. Nevertheless, those who adapted
to circumstances reported very good catches with multi sea winter salmon plentiful in June. A
pleasing run of grilse was evident in July and if we had more water sport would have been
excellent. Sea trout fishing was curtailed on the lower river meaning the run of fish was difficult
to assess as anglers don’t tend to fish upstream regularly. Maybe 2018 will see more fishing
effort above Bandon? Brown trout fishing was excellent at times, with nymph fishing picking
up many early season fish and dry fly coming into its own on warm summer evenings.<br><br></p>
<p>Fishing will continue on as normal for 2018, with opening day on February 15th. 
This year, we have decided to change proceedings and refreshments will be served on St. Patrick’s
Day, March 17th in the Munster Arms Hotel, Bandon, from 7.00pm. As always, we remind
anglers to record all salmon and sea trout over 40cm in their logbooks whether they are
retained or released, including salmon kelts, baggots and rawners. Also, make sure logbooks
are returned by <em>October 19th</em> so accurate figures are collated by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI).
The total allowable catch (TAC) for the Bandon has slightly increased for 2018 as anglers have
recorded their catches and returned logbooks in an efficient manner. Please continue to do
so. Anglers are still permitted to retain 10 salmon/sea trout over 40cm. However, Bandon
Angling Association encourages catch and release of both salmon and trout on club waters
throughout the season. Although it is not a rule, we would like to encourage single, barbless
hooks at the beginning of the season to minimise injury to kelts.<br><br></p>
<p>The dates set for payment of club permits are the <em>6th and 7th of February</em> from 7.00
pm to 9.30 pm in the Munster Arms Hotel. Season permit prices for the upcoming season
remain the same at <em>€150</em> and IFI state licenses will also be available for purchase. Payment
for state licenses is by cash only. An option for online payment is available for club permits.
Please email info@bandonangling.com for further information. We would advise all members
prompt payment of subs and for administration purposes, a strict deadline has been set
for <em>Sunday April 1st. Member permits will not be issued after this date</em>. As usual, when
receiving your permit you will also obtain a tag for your jacket/hat. This is a visual aid to help
fishery officers, water keepers and anglers alike to identify whether someone should be fishing
or not. We must stress this is not a licence and you must still carry your permit. We would
also like to remind members that referees are responsible for who they sponsor. Action will
be taken against members in breach of rules and their referees.<br><br></p>
<p>Weekend patrolling by club members was conducted in a very successful manner last
year, with cases of poaching declining over the summer. Remember, it is your river and your
sport which you are protecting. We sincerely thank you for all your efforts. If you suspect a
non-member is fishing, do not approach them and contact the designated persons whose
details are below. Patrols will begin again in the new season.<br><br></p>
<p>Bandon Angling Association carried out bank protection works at Deasy’s Turn as a
result of a successful application to the IFI Salmon Conservation Fund. This included rock
armouring approximately 60m of the north bank. Furthermore, we have been provisionally
granted additional funds for spawning stream enhancement work which will be extremely
beneficial to our population of trout in particular. This includes fencing, tree coppicing and
designating livestock drinking areas.<br><br></p>
<p>Water quality will receive a welcome boost on the Bandon this year as planning
permission has been granted for the Bandon Watermain and Sewage upgrade, plus the
Innishannon Sewage Scheme. Both of these schemes will see a significant improvement in
quality of discharges to the river. With regards to water quality degradation as a result of the
Bandon Flood Relief Scheme on the lower river, monitoring was conducted throughout the
works period. Where parameter limits were exceeded, works were downgraded or halted to
prevent injury to aquatic species. For more information on the scheme and a summary of
works to date, please visit www.bandonfrs.ie.<br><br></p>
<p>This year, we are reviving our former policy of initiating weekend bank clearing parties
to improve our club waters fishing potential. Assistant Development Officers have been
designated stretches to assess work potential and a Works Maintenance Organiser has been
appointed to assemble work groups. We would encourage all members to participate when
asked as it affords you an opportunity to get to know the river better and meet new people.</p>
