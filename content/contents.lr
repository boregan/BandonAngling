Bandon Angling Association (BAA) have officially launched a guiding service for the 2016 season.
Our qualified guides will offer you a professional service along eight miles of double bank fishing on West Cork’s beautiful Bandon River.
Whether you’re hoping for the dainty sip of a brown trout, the electric slam of a sea trout or the unmistakable draw of a salmon, we can offer you our experience so you get the best out of your day on the river.
