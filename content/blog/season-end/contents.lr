title: Season End
---
body: Another season done and dusted as the Bandon is now closed to trout and salmon fishing. Amazing looking back at the season and thinking how quickly it has gone by! Some nice fish were reported today with the biggest I saw estimated to weigh 12/13lbs caught on the fly. However, all were stale. Reflecting on the seasons salmon runs, the spring was better and far more encouraging, summer heralded a great run of grilse and summer salmon whilst the autumn was disappointing (an observation echoed nationwide and in the UK). Time to let the fish alone now and spawn the next generation to provide sport for years to come. We hope ye all enjoyed yer season and don't forget to return your logbooks to Inland Fisheries Ireland by October 19th. Roll on 2017!!ðŸŽ£ðŸŽ£ðŸŽ£
