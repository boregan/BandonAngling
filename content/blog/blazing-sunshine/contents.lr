Blazing sunshine and roasting temperatures have been the story so far this week as the summer truly grips West Cork. Far from ideal salmon fishing conditions, yet a few more fish to 13lb came to the bank. A couple of early grilse between 3 and 5lb were also caught and it seems there are a smattering of these throughout the system. Shrimp and spinner were the most productive methods.<br>
