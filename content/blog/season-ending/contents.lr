title: Season Ending
---
body: Not long to go now as the seasons end is drawing ever closer for both trout and salmon. As has been the theme for the past couple of weeks, a nice few fish to 14lbs were caught, and mostly released, with the majority of sport coming to the fly. An increased number of fresh fish running has been observed, however hooking up with one of these fish has proven to be difficult for most anglers. A good flood over the weekend has ensured that excellent water levels will see us out until the 30th, with the prospect of hooking up looking best on the fly. Tight lines for the next few days!!
