title: 8lb Springer
---
body:

More good news as a club member reported catching an 8lb springer yesterday evening on the fly. Water is perfect at the moment, with showers keeping the water at a steady level. Forecast is cold with showers of rain, which may be heavy on Sunday. With the great tides though and fish present, it is well worth a cast. Attached is a photo of a nice brown trout I recently released whilst salmon fishing. Great to see this calibre of trout present.<br>
