Bandon Angling Association was privileged to be in the company of world renowned fly fishing instructor Glenda Powell today. The scene was set as the weather and water conditions were perfect for demonstration. This morning, Glenda taught the Juniors (Bandon Scouts) all about the life cycle of salmonids and the basics of fly fishing. After a beautiful lunch (courtesy of the Munster Arms Hotel) she taught the Seniors a variety of techniques in double handed casting, such as the Spey and Snap T cast. From everyone involved today, thanks a million Glenda Powell!<br>
