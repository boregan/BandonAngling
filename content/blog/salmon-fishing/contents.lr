title: Salmon Fishing

body:

The best salmon fishing so far this season was experienced over the last week. Thankfully, the Bandon received a rise in water levels on Monday, however it was extremely short lived. At least it freshened up the system and got fish moving. Salmon caught ranged in size, from bigger, stale fish to bright grilse in the 3-5lb range. A good number of these were released and a few more were met and lost also.
