title: Another Week Down
---
body: Another week down and some excellent catches were made, particularly by visitors on day tickets. One gentleman and his friend had 5 fish between them to 17lbs and another visitor, Seamus Pyke, reported excellent sport with 5 fish landed. Seamus kindly sent us the attached video. Most fish encountered during the week were stale and returned to the river, with shrimp proving to be the most effective method. A few fresh fish up to 12lbs were also caught and seen running (including big MSW fish) so hopefully a more consistent run of autumn salmon is just around the corner. Finally, we would like to remind all BAA members that September is fly and spinner only on club waters.
