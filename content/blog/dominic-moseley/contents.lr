Mr. Dominic Moseley availed of our guiding service today and following some casting tuition was delighted to catch his first ever salmon,a 4lb grilse. Fishing was good along club waters, with a good few fish reported caught, including a couple fresh salmon. The river rose a few inches this afternoon and prospects for the rest of the week are fantastic.
