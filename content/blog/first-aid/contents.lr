body:

Yesterday, we held a First Aid course for our Waterkeepers and Fishing Guides at The Munster Arms hotel.<br>
A huge thanks goes out to club member, John O' Brien who was our instructor for the course. John, who is also a Paramedic really brought home to us, the importance of having basic First Aid. We would encourage anyone and everyone to do the same. You could save a life.
