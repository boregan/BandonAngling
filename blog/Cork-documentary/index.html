                    <p><p><b>Cork Opera House in association with Cork Harbour Festival presents
the documentary screening of
River Runner<br>
Tuesday 7 June, 7pm<br><br>
</b></p>
<p>River Runner is a unique documentary film by Cork film-maker Declan O’Mahony, which explores a myriad of controversial issues associated with Cork’s most famous landmark – the River Lee.<br></p>
<p>Central to the core of the film is the destruction of the river’s Wild Atlantic Salmon population, due to large-scale structural changes to the Lee over the past 60 years.<br></p>
<p>These changes have also driven the salmon-dependent, freshwater Pearl Mussel, close to extinction.<br></p>
<p>The film documents how Cork is home to a unique forest ecosystem known as ‘The Gearagh’, one of just four such systems left on the planet. This last pure strand of ancient, riverine forest which had survived intact since the end of the last ice age, was completely annihilated. It resulted in the clear felling of the ancient forest of ‘The Gearagh’, and the destruction of 39 homes and farmsteads.<br></p>
<p>The documentary explores how the construction of the hydro-electricity project and resulting dam, came at a shocking price to the environment.  It halted the migration of the Atlantic salmon, creating a watery desert devoid of all natural life, as trout, otter, eel and freshwater mussel stocks completely collapsed, and the Lee’s vibrant, angling-tourism industry was wiped out.<br></p>
<p>Speaking about the issues highlighted in his documentary, Cork film-maker, Declan O’Mahony said:<br></p>
<p>“Only two generations ago, Corks River Lee was alive with an over-abundance of Wild Atlantic Salmon, trout and eel. The river, from the wonderful harbour to its idyllic source at Gougane Barra, was an integral source of food, work and leisure for the citizens of Cork. Modernising our society from the 1950’s onwards, came with heavy penalties for our ancient natural resources. However we are now at a new chapter of development with critical climactic changes forcing us to re-evaluate our connection to nature. The Lee has a wonderfully unique inland forest delta which needs protection and proper development. It is ecologically intact and can be easily accomplished. Our Irish rivers are in desperate need of proper management. Obstacles in our major rivers like dams and weirs are outdated and can be modified and removed in accordance with European Environmental laws. Our rivers are part of our natural heritage and they urgently need our attention. It should be our highest priority to protect them for future generations of Irish people to enjoy”.<br></p>
<p>The film is narrated by ecologist, Kevin Corcoran, and Salmon Angling Expert, Alan Nolan. It tells the tale from the salmon’s perspective from sea to source and back again, outlining the many problems the fish faces on its arduous journey.<br></p>
<p>The film will be followed by a Q&amp;A, and Cork Environmental Forum’s ‘Green Drinks’ will give audience members a chance to meet, greet and chat with local and national environmental organisations.<br></p>
