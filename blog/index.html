<h3><b>River Update</b><hr></h3>

<h4><i>2016-03-21</i></h4>
<div class="general-updates">
  <h4><p>The river has dropped to a low level, with the banks and pools getting a much needed rest after all the winter floods. An angler met one springer up river during the week but no more fish were reported landed since last Saturday's hat trick. A few fish have been seen the last couple of days but the easterly winds and bright sunshine aren't helping.<br></p>
<p>Water Level: -0.02m.<br>
Water Temp: 9.4 degrees Celsius.</p>

<h3><b>Bandon Angling Association Guiding</b><hr></h3>

<div class="general-updates">

Our qualified guides will offer you a professional service along eight miles of double bank fishing on West Cork’s beautiful Bandon River.

<h3><b>Club Newsletter</b><hr></h3>

<h4><i>2016-03-16</i></h4>
<div class="general-updates">
  <h4><p><strong><em>2016 Newsletter</em></strong></p>
<p>Opening day of the new season on the Bandon is just around the corner and with it comes refreshed enthusiasm. We hoped for more rain in 2015 and we certainly received it! For the majority of the summer the river was in beautiful condition for salmon fishing, alas the run of fish didn’t match expectations. Spring fishing was extremely poor, with the best action coming in July and August. Whilst some enjoyed very good sport, too many failed miserably through no fault of their own. However, we witnessed an improved run of sea trout with some beautiful specimens amongst them. Excellent brown trout fishing was also experienced by several anglers when conditions suited, both in quality and quantity.<br><br></p>
<p>This year our fishing will continue on as normal, with opening day on February 15th . Our opening day meet is in the Munster Arms Hotel, Bandon, where refreshments will be served from 5.30pm. As always, we remind anglers to record all salmon and sea trout over 40cm in their logbooks whether they are retained or released, including salmon kelts, baggots and rawners. Also, make sure logbooks are returned by October 19 th so accurate figures are collated by IFI. The total allowable catch (TAC) for the Bandon has decreased for 2016 and if catches of fish are not fully reported, we may see a return of brown tags in the not too distant future. Anglers are still permitted to retain 10 salmon/sea trout over 40cm.<br><br></p>
<p>The dates set for payment of club permits are the 9 th and 10 th of February at 7.00 pm to 9.30pm in the Munster Arms Hotel. Season permit prices for the upcoming season remain the same at €150. When receiving your permit you will also obtain a tag for your jacket or hat. The tag, along with licence, will change colour for the coming season. This is a visual aid to help fishery officers, water keepers and anglers alike to identify whether someone should be fishing or not. We must stress this is not a licence and you must still carry your permit.<br><br></p>
<p>The summer of 2015 finally saw the commencement and completion of our river works plan. This work consisted of enhancing angling potential and counteracting erosion on six pools, from Pot Hole to Deasy’s Turn. Already, the work has proved extremely successful with several salmon caught. If you haven’t seen the works already, then a video of it can be seen on our website, <a href="http://bandonangling.com">bandonangling.com</a>.<br><br></p>
<p>Water quality on the Bandon last year was good but came under pressure on a few occasions. Thankfully, these incidents were dealt with accordingly and signs of improved water quality throughout the system as a whole are extremely encouraging. Club members are asked to be observant and report anything suspicious to our Environmental Officer. The Bandon Flood Relief Scheme and Bandon Watermain and Sewerage Upgrade are due to commence in the second half of 2016. Delays in both schemes have proved to be a major setback to Bandon, particularly this winter, and their impending implementation is most welcome by all.<br><br></p>
<p>Due to the incessant rain and floods that we have endured, there is no doubt that the river bed and banks will have changed in some locations. When making your first casts of the season, be aware of shifted gravel and undercut river banks. Finally, poaching was a frequent nuisance at times last year, with trout bearing the brunt of it. If you suspect a non-member is fishing club waters, do not approach them and contact the Club Mobile or Fisheries Officers immediately.<br><br></p>

<h3><b>About The River</b><hr></h3>

<h4><i>2016-01-01</i></h4>
<div class="general-updates">
  <h4><p>The River Bandon is a most scenic and prolific game fishing river flowing through some of the most picturesque country side in West Cork. It's source is a few miles north west of Dunmanway from where it flows through that town and about 11 miles further on through the villages of Ballineen and Enniskeane. Kilcoleman is 3 miles down stream of Enniskeane.<br><br></p>
<p>After Kilcoleman it continues through a fertile valley and through the town of Bandon. Here there is a very old weir which is a feature of the town and is floodlit at night. A modern fish pass is installed on this weir which allows migrating salmon and sea trout to pass on up river. One can observe salmon jumping this weir in high water conditions and is indeed a magnificent site if one happens to be there at 'the right time'.<br>
From Bandon the river follows the main Cork road to the town of Innishannon where it passes under the Cork road.<br><br></p>
<p>At this point the river is tidal and effected by salt water. The river widens dramatically from here on and the estuary widens dramatically. The road from Innishannon to Kinsale bounds the river for most of the way to Kinsale. Kinsale is a beautiful little coastal town. Know as the gourmet capital of Ireland it boasts some of the best restaurants in Europe. There is are many good hotels and B&amp;B's.</p>
