<h3><b>Cork Documentary &#39;River Runner&#39;</b><hr></h3>

<h4><i>2016-06-01</i></h4>
<div class="general-updates">
  <h4><p><b>Cork Opera House in association with Cork Harbour Festival presents
the documentary screening of
River Runner<br>
Tuesday 7 June, 7pm<br><br>
</b></p>
<p>River Runner is a unique documentary film by Cork film-maker Declan O’Mahony, which explores a myriad of controversial issues associated with Cork’s most famous landmark – the River Lee.<br></p>
<p>Central to the core of the film is the destruction of the river’s Wild Atlantic Salmon population, due to large-scale structural changes to the Lee over the past 60 years.<br></p>
<p>These changes have also driven the salmon-dependent, freshwater Pearl Mussel, close to extinction.<br></p>
<p>The film documents how Cork is home to a unique forest ecosystem known as ‘The Gearagh’, one of just four such systems left on the planet. This last pure strand of ancient, riverine forest which had survived intact since the end of the last ice age, was completely annihilated. It resulted in the clear felling of the ancient forest of ‘The Gearagh’, and the destruction of 39 homes and farmsteads.<br></p>
<p>The documentary explores how the construction of the hydro-electricity project and resulting dam, came at a shocking price to the environment.  It halted the migration of the Atlantic salmon, creating a watery desert devoid of all natural life, as trout, otter, eel and freshwater mussel stocks completely collapsed, and the Lee’s vibrant, angling-tourism industry was wiped out.<br></p>
<p>Speaking about the issues highlighted in his documentary, Cork film-maker, Declan O’Mahony said:<br></p>
<p>“Only two generations ago, Corks River Lee was alive with an over-abundance of Wild Atlantic Salmon, trout and eel. The river, from the wonderful harbour to its idyllic source at Gougane Barra, was an integral source of food, work and leisure for the citizens of Cork. Modernising our society from the 1950’s onwards, came with heavy penalties for our ancient natural resources. However we are now at a new chapter of development with critical climactic changes forcing us to re-evaluate our connection to nature. The Lee has a wonderfully unique inland forest delta which needs protection and proper development. It is ecologically intact and can be easily accomplished. Our Irish rivers are in desperate need of proper management. Obstacles in our major rivers like dams and weirs are outdated and can be modified and removed in accordance with European Environmental laws. Our rivers are part of our natural heritage and they urgently need our attention. It should be our highest priority to protect them for future generations of Irish people to enjoy”.<br></p>
<p>The film is narrated by ecologist, Kevin Corcoran, and Salmon Angling Expert, Alan Nolan. It tells the tale from the salmon’s perspective from sea to source and back again, outlining the many problems the fish faces on its arduous journey.<br></p>
<p>The film will be followed by a Q&amp;A, and Cork Environmental Forum’s ‘Green Drinks’ will give audience members a chance to meet, greet and chat with local and national environmental organisations.<br></p>
<p>River Runner screens at the Cork Opera House, on Tuesday 7 June at 7pm. Tickets can be purchased online at <a href="http://www.corkoperahouse.ie">http://www.corkoperahouse.ie</a> or by calling the box office on <i>021-4270022</i>.<br><br></p>

<h3><b>Blazing Sunshine</b><hr></h3>

<h4><i>2016-05-30</i></h4>
<div class="general-updates">
  <h4><p>Blazing sunshine and roasting temperatures have been the story so far this week as the summer truly grips West Cork. Far from ideal salmon fishing conditions, yet a few more fish to 13lb came to the bank. A couple of early grilse between 3 and 5lb were also caught and it seems there are a smattering of these throughout the system. Shrimp and spinner were the most productive methods.<br></p>
<p><img src="https://scontent-lhr3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13335735_1065002076872470_6047023269594553307_n.jpg?oh=ee169fe20a27698641e1f8500288999d&oe=57DE8944" class="img-responsive blog-img-col center-align"></p>

<h3><b>11 Fish</b><hr></h3>

<h4><i>2016-05-25</i></h4>
<div class="general-updates">
  <h4><p>Fishing on the Bandon is now beginning to pick up momentum as 11 fish were reported caught during the week, 5 of which were intercepted yesterday. The quality of salmon is excellent, with most weighing between 8 and 14lb. One grilse of 4.5lb was also captured. More were lost, including another belter estimated at 20lb. One of these big fish will come to the bank yet!<br></p>
<p>BAA guide Phil Dewey looks happy with this beauty weighing 13.2lb.<br></p>

<h3><b>R.I.P. Dick Lee</b><hr></h3>

<h4><i>2016-05-17</i></h4>
<div class="general-updates">
  <h4><p>Before I update on the latest fishing news, Bandon Angling Association wishes to offer our sincere condolences to the Lee family after the death of Richard 'Dick' Lee. Dick was the President of BAA and his presence will be sorely missed by all who knew him.<br></p>
<p>On the fishing front, the flood has produced an increased catch of salmon with a few more lost, including one fish estimated to weigh between 15-20lb. Most fish caught are weighing 9-11lb and are in prime condition. Salmon continue to run despite the lower, clear water. The river is now a pleasure to fish as the algae has been flushed out.<br></p>
<p>Finally, attached is a link to the current issue of 'Off The Scale' which includes an article I wrote detailing the youth fly fishing tuition day we recently hosted with Glenda Powell. Hope you enjoy the read!<br></p>
