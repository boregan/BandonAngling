<h3><b>Congratulations David!</b><hr></h3>

<h4><i>2016-06-04</i></h4>
<div class="general-updates">
  <h4><p>Big congratulations to BAA PR Officer David Forde for catching this magnificent specimen salmon of 21lbs 2oz!<br></p>
<p>David Ford from the Evening Echo tells Willie Roche IFI about a superb 21lbs 2oz salmon taken in Bandon River on 1st June:
Having attended a meeting which finished at 9 pm in Bandon David headed out for a cast to wind down for the evening. Drove to river, water was low and lovely weather so went down in ‘meeting clothes and shoes’. Fishing a 12ft rod and a size 12 Cascade he got a small touch on 4th cast and then a take on the next cast to the same lie. Lifted and fish began to fly around the pool. And so began a ¾ hr struggle – down to the backing twice, then ½ way down to backing and fish jumped and then David realised the size of it. Played it to a standstill as had to and then tried to land it in his trout net. Missed the first time and fish took off again, at third time of trying fish was scooped into the net and in the lifting the net handle broke. But David caught the net rim and landed.<br></p>
<p>David has caught 100s of salmon from different waters but this was ‘the one’. The best fish ever – officially weighed and specimen claim will be coming to ISFC very shortly. It was a sea trout evening – balmy, dusk, low water – but rivers like the Bandon are producing not alone sea trout but some superb salmon even under less than ideal conditions.<br></p>
<p>David Forde is no stranger to large fish.  In April 2013 he had another <a href="http://fishinginireland.info/news/salmon-reports/salmon-to-21lb-from-the-bandon-today/">super 21lb salmon from the Bandon</a><br><br></p>

<h3><b>Cork Documentary &#39;River Runner&#39;</b><hr></h3>

<h4><i>2016-06-01</i></h4>
<div class="general-updates">
  <h4><p><b>Cork Opera House in association with Cork Harbour Festival presents
the documentary screening of
River Runner<br>
Tuesday 7 June, 7pm<br><br>
</b></p>
<p>River Runner is a unique documentary film by Cork film-maker Declan O’Mahony, which explores a myriad of controversial issues associated with Cork’s most famous landmark – the River Lee.<br></p>
<p>Central to the core of the film is the destruction of the river’s Wild Atlantic Salmon population, due to large-scale structural changes to the Lee over the past 60 years.<br></p>
<p>These changes have also driven the salmon-dependent, freshwater Pearl Mussel, close to extinction.<br></p>
<p>The film documents how Cork is home to a unique forest ecosystem known as ‘The Gearagh’, one of just four such systems left on the planet. This last pure strand of ancient, riverine forest which had survived intact since the end of the last ice age, was completely annihilated. It resulted in the clear felling of the ancient forest of ‘The Gearagh’, and the destruction of 39 homes and farmsteads.<br></p>
<p>The documentary explores how the construction of the hydro-electricity project and resulting dam, came at a shocking price to the environment.  It halted the migration of the Atlantic salmon, creating a watery desert devoid of all natural life, as trout, otter, eel and freshwater mussel stocks completely collapsed, and the Lee’s vibrant, angling-tourism industry was wiped out.<br></p>
<p>Speaking about the issues highlighted in his documentary, Cork film-maker, Declan O’Mahony said:<br></p>
<p>“Only two generations ago, Corks River Lee was alive with an over-abundance of Wild Atlantic Salmon, trout and eel. The river, from the wonderful harbour to its idyllic source at Gougane Barra, was an integral source of food, work and leisure for the citizens of Cork. Modernising our society from the 1950’s onwards, came with heavy penalties for our ancient natural resources. However we are now at a new chapter of development with critical climactic changes forcing us to re-evaluate our connection to nature. The Lee has a wonderfully unique inland forest delta which needs protection and proper development. It is ecologically intact and can be easily accomplished. Our Irish rivers are in desperate need of proper management. Obstacles in our major rivers like dams and weirs are outdated and can be modified and removed in accordance with European Environmental laws. Our rivers are part of our natural heritage and they urgently need our attention. It should be our highest priority to protect them for future generations of Irish people to enjoy”.<br></p>
<p>The film is narrated by ecologist, Kevin Corcoran, and Salmon Angling Expert, Alan Nolan. It tells the tale from the salmon’s perspective from sea to source and back again, outlining the many problems the fish faces on its arduous journey.<br></p>
<p>The film will be followed by a Q&amp;A, and Cork Environmental Forum’s ‘Green Drinks’ will give audience members a chance to meet, greet and chat with local and national environmental organisations.<br></p>
<p>River Runner screens at the Cork Opera House, on Tuesday 7 June at 7pm. Tickets can be purchased online at <a href="http://www.corkoperahouse.ie">http://www.corkoperahouse.ie</a> or by calling the box office on <i>021-4270022</i>.<br><br></p>

<h3><b>Blazing Sunshine</b><hr></h3>

<h4><i>2016-05-30</i></h4>
<div class="general-updates">
  <h4><p>Blazing sunshine and roasting temperatures have been the story so far this week as the summer truly grips West Cork. Far from ideal salmon fishing conditions, yet a few more fish to 13lb came to the bank. A couple of early grilse between 3 and 5lb were also caught and it seems there are a smattering of these throughout the system. Shrimp and spinner were the most productive methods.<br></p>
<p><img src="https://scontent-lhr3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13335735_1065002076872470_6047023269594553307_n.jpg?oh=ee169fe20a27698641e1f8500288999d&oe=57DE8944" class="img-responsive blog-img-col center-align"></p>

<h3><b>11 Fish</b><hr></h3>

<h4><i>2016-05-25</i></h4>
<div class="general-updates">
  <h4><p>Fishing on the Bandon is now beginning to pick up momentum as 11 fish were reported caught during the week, 5 of which were intercepted yesterday. The quality of salmon is excellent, with most weighing between 8 and 14lb. One grilse of 4.5lb was also captured. More were lost, including another belter estimated at 20lb. One of these big fish will come to the bank yet!<br></p>
<p>BAA guide Phil Dewey looks happy with this beauty weighing 13.2lb.<br></p>
